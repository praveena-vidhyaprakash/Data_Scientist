# Data Scientist – Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of **Machine Learning algorithms** organized by **Supervised** and **Unsupervised Learning** methods, along with links to respective GitHub repositories for each algorithm.

## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models for predictions. It is divided into two types:

### 1. Classification

- **Decision Trees** – [Decision Tree Repo](https://github.com/pb111/Decision-Tree-Classification)  
- **Random Forest** – [Random Forest Repo](https://github.com/LJadhav25/Decision-Tree-Random-Forest-Algorithm-Data-Science-)  
- **SVM (Support Vector Machines)** – [SVM Repo](https://github.com/pb111/Support-Vector-Machines-Project)  
- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** – [KNN Repo](https://github.com/ghimiresunil/Scratch-implementation-of-KNN)  
- **Logistic Regression** – [Logistic Regression Repo](https://github.com/pb111/Logistic-Regression-in-Python-Project)  
- **Naive Bayes** – [Naive Bayes Repo](https://github.com/shiivashaakeri/Naive-Bayes-Classifier-From-Scratch)  
- **Gradient Boosting** – [Gradient Boosting Repo](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost)

### 2. Regression

- **Linear Regression** – [Linear Regression Repo](https://github.com/tatwan/Linear-Regression-Implementation-in-Python)  
- **Ridge Regression** – [Ridge Regression Repo](https://github.com/akash18tripathi/Linear-Regression-from-Scratch)  
- **Lasso Regression** – [Lasso Regression Repo](https://github.com/akash18tripathi/Linear-Regression-from-Scratch)  
- **Elastic Net Regression** – [Elastic Net Repo](https://github.com/marcogdepinto/Python-for-Data-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning)

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning uses **unlabeled data** to find patterns and relationships.

### 1. Clustering

- **K-Means** – [K-Means Repo](https://github.com/topics/k-means)  
- **Hierarchical Clustering** – [Hierarchical Clustering Repo](https://github.com/topics/hierarchical-clustering)  
- **DBSCAN** – [DBSCAN Repo](https://github.com/topics/dbscan)

### 2. Dimensionality Reduction

- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** – [PCA Repo](https://github.com/topics/principal-component-analysis)

## 📌 Notes

- Replace the example repositories with your own implementations if needed.  
- This structure is ideal for **Data Science portfolio projects** or **Machine Learning learning paths**.  
- Add badges, examples, and datasets to enhance the README.
