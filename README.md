## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models for predictions. It is divided into two types:

### 1. Classification

- **Decision Trees** – [Decision Tree Repo](https://github.com/praveena-vidhyaprakash/Travel_interest_app)  
- **Random Forest** – [Random Forest Repo](https://github.com/praveena-vidhyaprakash/Student_Career_Path_Predictor)  
- **SVM (Support Vector Machines)** – [SVM Repo](https://github.com/praveena-vidhyaprakash/Breast_Cancer_Pred)  
- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** – [KNN Repo](https://github.com/praveena-vidhyaprakash/Song_Gernre_Classifier)  
- **Logistic Regression** – [Logistic Regression Repo](https://github.com/praveena-vidhyaprakash/Sentiment_predictor)  
- **Naive Bayes** – [Naive Bayes Repo](https://github.com/praveena-vidhyaprakash/Play_Tennis_Predictor-)  
- **Gradient Boosting** – [Gradient Boosting Repo](https://github.com/praveena-vidhyaprakash/Music_Skip_Predictor)

### 2. Regression

- **Linear Regression** – [Linear Regression Repo](https://github.com/praveena-vidhyaprakash/Monthly_Spend_Predictor)  
- **Ridge Regression** – [Ridge Regression Repo](https://github.com/praveena-vidhyaprakash/Student_Grade_Predictor)  
- **Lasso Regression** – [Lasso Regression Repo](https://github.com/praveena-vidhyaprakash/House_Prediction_App)  
- **Elastic Net Regression** – [Elastic Net Repo](https://github.com/praveena-vidhyaprakash/Job_Acceptance_Prediction)

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning uses **unlabeled data** to find patterns and relationships.

### 1. Clustering

- **K-Means** – [K-Means Repo](https://github.com/praveena-vidhyaprakash/Spotify-Segmentation-App)  
- **Hierarchical Clustering** – [Hierarchical Clustering Repo](https://github.com/praveena-vidhyaprakash/Movie_Taste_Clustering)  
- **DBSCAN** – [DBSCAN Repo](https://github.com/praveena-vidhyaprakash/Tourist_Attraction)

### 2. Dimensionality Reduction

- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** – [PCA Repo](https://github.com/praveena-vidhyaprakash/Shopping_Habbit)
